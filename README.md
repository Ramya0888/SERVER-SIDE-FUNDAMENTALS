Server-Side Fundamentals :
This project is a comprehensive educational web application designed to help learners understand the core concepts of server-side engineering. It functions as a visually rich and content-driven article-style webpage, built with React, and aimed at providing a solid foundation in backend technologies, architecture, and best practices.

 Overview:
Server-side development plays a crucial role in modern web applications. While frontend handles user interfaces and client interactions, the server side is where the logic happens — managing requests, data processing, database interaction, authentication, and more. This application breaks down these responsibilities into intuitive, easy-to-understand topics.

The site covers the following major areas:

What happens on the server

APIs & Routing

Databases and relationships

Security and performance

Frontend interaction with backend (HTTP requests)

Each section contains real-world examples, sample code snippets (Node.js, Express, SQL, MongoDB), and explanations designed for beginners.

Technologies Used:
React.js – Frontend library used to build this SPA (Single Page Application)

React Router – For navigating between multiple content pages

HTML & CSS (inline styles + background images) – For layout and visual structure

JavaScript (ES6+) – Used throughout to manage interactivity and component logic

Express.js (code samples) – Shown for server examples

MongoDB & MySQL (code snippets) – Used to demonstrate database integration

Note: The application is static and meant for educational walkthroughs. No live backend or database is connected, but simulated code playgrounds and formatted JSON responses help learners understand interactions.

Topics Covered:
1. Server-Side Basics
Explains how the backend works — handling HTTP requests, running business logic, interacting with databases, and generating responses.

2. APIs & Routing
Introduces RESTful API concepts, Express.js routing, CRUD operations, dynamic routes, middleware, and route grouping.

3. Databases
Details relational and NoSQL databases, their differences, relationships like One-to-One/Many-to-Many, along with SQL and MongoDB code samples. Also discusses indexing, schema design, transactions, and ORM/ODM usage.

4. Security and Performance
Describes best practices for authentication, input validation, caching, CDN usage, HTTPS, rate limiting, and secure deployments.

5. Frontend Interaction
Covers how frontends interact with servers using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and demonstrates JSON response structures and fetch request formats.

How to Use:
Clone or download the repository

Run npm install to install dependencies

Start the development server using npm start

 Purpose:
This project was built as part of a learning module or academic submission to help students learn server-side engineering. Each page is styled to resemble an article, and the entire layout is optimized for both readability and clarity.
